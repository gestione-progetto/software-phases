# Verification & Validation

Verification and validation phase aims to check that the software system 
meets its specification. 

**Validation** is the 
activity that answers the floowing questions: 
* Did we build the system that the customer wants?

**Verification** answers the following question: 
* Did we build the system right? 

The verification
can be performed at different levels. 
* It can be
performed at the **unit level** in which we test that the individual
units work as a expected. 
* It can be performed in the **integration level**
in which we test the interaction between the different units.
We want to make sure that the different modules talk
to each other in the right way. 
* Finally, there is **system level** in which we test the system as a whole and we
want to make sure that all the system, all the different pieces
of the system work together in the right
way. And this is also the level at which then we will apply validation and some other
testing techniques like stress testing or robustness testing and so on.
