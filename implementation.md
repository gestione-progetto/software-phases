# Implementation or coding

In the implementation or coding phase we take care of realizing the design of the system that we just created in the previous phase. 
There are four fundamental principles that can affect the way in which software is constructed. 


## Four principles

* Reduction of complexity. This aims to build software that is easier to understand and use.
* Anticipation of diversity.  This takes into account that software construction might change in various way over time.
* Structuring for valifation. This aims to design software for testability.
* Use of external or internal standards. It is important that the software conforms to a set of internal or external standards.
